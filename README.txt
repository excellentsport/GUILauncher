GUI Launcher

This is a rewrite of a launcher program written by Asger Juul Brunshøj, found here: https://github.com/plul/Public-AutoHotKey-Scripts

I borrowed heavily from his original program, but made a great deal of other modifications based on things I thought would be nice to have, like a queryable list of commands, etc.

To use, launch the "GUI.ahk" script, which will run in the background. Hit "CAPSLOCK and Space" together to launch the input menu.
